# Forming-Optimal-Groups

In the field of teaching university courses, a question that has received considerable attention is this:

What is the best way to put students into groups?

There are arguments for making groups heteregenous, and other arugments for making them homogeneous. What is best may depend on the kind of work, the size of the group, or what attributes we are basing the grouping on. For example, we might want groups with heterogeneous programs of study, so students bring different perspectives. Or we might want homogeneous neighbourhoods, so students from who live nearby can meet to work together in person. Or we may want a combination of these criteria. Of course, to apply criteria like these, we need the relevant information about the students (their program of study, or college, for instance). We can get that by surveying the students.

Therefore, I wrote a program that analyzes an instructor’s criteria for good groups, plus data extracted from a student survey, to make groups that are optimal with respect to the criteria.
